      The Ermine, haidarum subspecies (Mustela erminea haidarum, hereafter ‘Haida Ermine’) is a subspecies of Ermine (Short-tailed Weasel). It has a typical weasel form, with a small face, short, oval ears, and a slender, elongated body with a furred, black-tipped tail. The summer pelage changes from reddish-brown upperparts and creamy-white lower parts to white in winter. The subspecific status of Haida Ermine is based on unique morphometric characters and is supported by genetic analyses. The Haida Ermine has been isolated from the mainland for approximately 11,000 years and is significant as evidence of the existence of a glacial refugium in the north Pacific coast, and one of four genetic clades of Ermine worldwide.

      elatively little is known about the biology of the Haida Ermine. Based on Ermine biology on the mainland, which should be similar among subspecies, Haida Ermine likely breed in the summer/autumn, and have one litter of 4 - 6 kits the following spring. The lifespan of most individuals is less than two years. Haida Ermine are opportunistic predators that rely on small mammals, birds, and invertebrates, and scavenge on Sitka Black-tailed Deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis).

Historically, Haida Ermine likely had a naturally low population size because of a limited prey base, and are likely to decline in the future due to various threats. The main threats to the Haida Ermine are habitat changes from increased competition and predation associated with various wildlife species introductions on Haida Gwaii. Introduced Deer have severely reduced understorey vegetation in much of the known Haida Ermine range, which has likely increased mortality rates from predators, and reduced populations of preferred prey species for Haida Ermine. The native Pacific Marten (Martes caurina)population has increased, likely from the introduction of Deer (a source of carrion) and Red Squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). Pacific Marten compete with Haida Ermine for the limited food base, and also may be a predation threat. Unlike Pacific Marten, Haida Ermine likely do not benefit from the introduction of Red Squirrel and rats.

Haida Ermine are trapped accidentally in traps set for Pacific Marten. The low Haida Ermine population may be impacted by trapping but the threat is difficult to quantify because trap effort is unknown. Rat eradication programs on several islands in Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve likely have not impacted Haida Ermine.
