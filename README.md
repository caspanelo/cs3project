Website Title: Amazing Animals and All About Them!

Website Summary/Description:
    For this ComSci assignment, I will be working solo. I plan on making a website that will teach people about
  different species of unusual animals. (Ex. the bird species that excretes the poison from its feathers)
    What I would like to make as the main feature of this website is having a little animated avatar that follows
  the user across the website’s pages, and levels up the more pages the player reads. I believe that this would
  encourage users to read more of the pages on the website. After all, the user gets to learn new facts about
  animals and also feel a sense of accomplishment from gaining levels on their avatar. If possible, the avatar
  will also be partially customizable in wearing accessories and will unlock more accessories each level up. I
  think that this would encourage the users further. For simplicity, convenience, and flexibility, the user’s
  avatar will be an all black humanoid creature, but not human. I hope I can find a way to make it look as
  cute/friendly as possible while keeping the design minimalistic. It will probably look like a black cat
  standing/walking on its hind legs.
  
Website Outline:
  Homepage
      The… homepage. Will include the logo/title of the website. Below the logo/title of the website, there will
    be a summary/description of the website. Below that, there will be the table of contents that stretches
    downwards like the Wikipedia’s table of contents. Next to it would be a rectangular box containing the user’s
    avatar. Upon clicking a link from the table of contents, the avatar will partially “break the 4th wall”, and
    leave the box. It will put a ladder under the box and climb down until it reaches the link pressed, a door
    will materialize, it will open the door and enter it, then the user will be redirected to page chosen. At the
    bottom of the homepage, there will be the regular “Found a bug?”, and the copyright.
